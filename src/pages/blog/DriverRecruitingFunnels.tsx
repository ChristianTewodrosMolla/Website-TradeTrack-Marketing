                The Problem with Traditional Driver Recruiting
              </h2>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
                Most small fleets rely on job boards and word-of-mouth, resulting in inconsistent applications and high turnover. Digital recruiting funnels provide a systematic approach to building a steady pipeline of qualified drivers.
              </p>

                Facebook & Instagram Ad Strategy
              </h2>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
                Target drivers based on location, interests, and demographics. Use carousel ads showcasing your trucks, benefits, and driver testimonials. Video content performs particularly well in the trucking industry.
              </p>

                Landing Page Optimization
              </h2>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
                Create dedicated landing pages for each recruiting campaign. Include clear value propositions, application forms, and social proof. Mobile optimization is crucial since many drivers apply from their phones.
              </p>

              </h2>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
                Implement automated email and SMS sequences to nurture leads. Send application confirmations, company information, and schedule interviews automatically. This reduces manual work and improves response rates.
